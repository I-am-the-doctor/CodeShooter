TODO list for CubeShooter
=========================

General:
 - should we create some kind of "ResourceManager"? Otherwise each entity loads it's stuff on itself, which is inefficient

Game:
 - basic networking
 - finish collision detection
 - implement some kind of "orbiting camera"
 - …
 - 3D-A* pathfinding for the AI?


Engine:
 - parsing of OBJ material (".mtl") files
 - finish specular and "glow" texture mapping support
 - …
